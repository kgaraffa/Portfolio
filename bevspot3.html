      <h1 class="project-title">Improve Order Detail Line Item Matching</h1>
      <p class="project-description">Implementation of AI to streamline invoice processing by analyzing invoices then indicating matches and educated guesses.</p>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Users are not taking the time to match returned, unmatched invoice line items to items within the app. If we could eliminate the human factor for more line items, we would get better adoption rates.</p>
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the order detail line item UI so it is more readable</li>
        <li>Provide indicators when AI successfully matched an item, took a guess and did not attempt to guess</li>
        <li>Give the user the ability to mark a line item as checked</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Improving Line Item UI</h2>
      <p>By employing the 'Crazy 8s' method, I generated eight distinct mockups using Figma. These mockups explore various ways to showcase order detail line items.</p>

      <h2>Creating Matching Logic UI</h2>
      <p>After carefully analyzing the requirements, it was determined that three options would be available: a 100% match, an educated guess, or no guess at all. Working with Product, we wrote out the scenarios for the three situations.</p>
      <p>100% Match</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invoice item sku matches sku of a packaging/vendor relationship or item and invoice line item has been mapped previously</li>
        <li>Packaging matches</li>
        <li>Vendor exists on that given packaging or item</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Educated Guess</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invoice item sku matches sku of a packaging/vendor relationship or item but invoice line item has ever been mapped before</li>
        <li>Any assumptions made for qty or price</li>
        <li>Invoice line item name matches item card name 1:1</li>
        <li>Packaging not null or matchable to dropdown</li>
        <li>Last three orders same map to packaging</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No Guess At All</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Packaging is null or un-matchable to dropdown</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once the requirements were finalized, I went to Figma to devise a strategy for effectively notifying the user about the various scenarios in the UI.</p>
      <img src="img/bs_14.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
      <ul>
        <li>No color would indicate that we are 100% confident that this line item is correct</li>
        <li>Yellow/ Orange would be an educated guess, alerting user to double check this with their original order and invoice</li>
        <li>Red would mean we were unable to make an educated guess or 100% match</li>
        <li>The user could hover over the packaging and get the actual line item information from the invoice that was extracted</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="img/bs_15.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
      <ul>
        <li>The user would be able to check that they looked for the line item and everything is good</li>
        <li>Once a selection or action was made on the no guess items, they would appear good</li>
        <li>If a user checked the line item using the checkmark, the educated guess items would show as no action</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="img/bs_16.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
      <ul>
        <li>After all line item information is added/ checked by the user, the ideal state would be every line item with green check mark</li>
        <li>If item does not have a match at all, once matched the UI would show markings</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <hr/>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Once engineering is able to provide the backend for line item matching with a confidence score, I will work closely with an engineer to implement the UI.</p>
      <p>We will then use analytics to see if the number of approved invoices increases over time with the easier, more intutitive UI. All the while taking feedback from customers on the design and accuracy of line item matching.</p>

          within the UI.</p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The lack of user approval for invoices stems from the time-consuming task of manually cross-checking line 
          items against processed invoices. This inefficiency hinders the timely verification of invoices, impacting 
          financial processes and necessitating a solution to streamline and expedite the approval workflow.</p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enhance the UI for order detail line items to improve readability.</li>
          <li>Include indicators for successful AI matching, educated guesses and cases where AI did not attempt to
            guess.</li>
          <li>Enable users to mark line items as checked.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Redesigning Line Item UI</h2>
        <p>By employing the 'Crazy 8s' method, I generated eight distinct mockups using Figma. These mockups explore
          various ways to showcase order detail line items.</p>
        <img src="img/bs_13.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <p>Once the eight designs were reviewed, I iterated on the feedback received from Product and Customer Success until I
          received approval for the new line item design.
        </p>
        <h2>Line Item Matching UX</h2>
        <p>After carefully analyzing the requirements, it was determined that three options would be available: a 100%
          match, an educated guess, or no guess at all. Working with Product, we wrote out the scenarios for the three
          situations.</p>
        <p>100% Match</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Invoice item SKU matches the SKU of a packaging/vendor relationship or the item and invoice line item hadRed indicates that we were unable to make an educated guess or achieve a 100% match
            been mapped previously.</li>
          <li>Packaging matches.</li>
          <li>Vendor exists for that given packaging or item.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Educated Guess</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Invoice item SKU matches the SKU of a packaging/vendor relationship or the item, but the invoice line item
            has not been mapped before.</li>
          <li>Any assumptions made for quantity or price.</li>
          <li>Invoice line item name matches the item card name exactly.</li>
          <li>Packaging is not null or can be matched to a dropdown option.</li>
          <li>Last three orders are mapped to the same packaging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No Guess At All</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Packaging is null or cannot be matched to a dropdown option.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Creating Line Item Matching UI</h2>
        <p>Once the requirements were finalized, I went to Figma to devise a strategy for effectively notifying the user
          about the various scenarios in the UI.</p>
        <img src="img/bs_14.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <ul>
          <li>No color indicates that we are 100% confident that this line item is correct.</li>
          <li>Yellow/Orange indicates an educated guess, suggesting the user to double check with their
            original order and invoice.</li>
          <li>Red indicates that we were unable to make an educated guess or achieve a 100% match.</li>
          <li>The user can hover over the packaging to extract the actual line item information from
            the invoice.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/bs_15.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <ul>
          <li>The user can verify that they have checked the line item and everything is satisfactory.</li>
          <li>After making a selection or taking an action on the items with an educated guess, the indicators would be 
            removed.</li>
          <li>If a user verifies the line item using a checkmark, the items with an educated guess will be marked as
            having no action required.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/bs_16.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <ul>
          <li>Once the user has added or verified all the line item information, the desired outcome is to have a green
            check mark next to each line item.</li>
          <li>If an item initially has no match, the UI will display markings once a match is found.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Once the engineering team is able to achieve the backend for line item matching along with a confidence score, 
          I will collaborate closely with an engineer to incorporate the front end UI.</p>
        <p>We will then utilize analytics to evaluate the potential increase in approved invoices over time as a result of 
          the new, intuitive UI. Throughout this process, we will actively gather feedback from users regarding 
          the design and accuracy of line item matching.</p>

        <p class="project-description">Enhancing the UX/UI for users with multiple vendors selling the same item in
          multiple sizes.</p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Managing inventory and reporting becomes complex for a user who consumes the same item from different vendors
          and in varying sizes. This situation creates challenges in accurately counting inventory and reporting,
          especially when multiple instances of the same item are obtained from different vendors and in different
          sizes. The user's objective is to effectively manage a single item that comes in multiple packaging sizes from
          different vendors, allowing for easy comparison of costs among different purchasing options.</p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Redesign the Item Card to be able to add multiple vendors to a given packaging size.</li>
          <li>Redesign Cart Builder to showcase the different packaging sizes and vendors for a single item.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Redesigning the Item Card</h2>
        <p>By employing the 'Crazy 8s' method, I generated eight distinct mockups using Figma. These mockups explore
          various approaches to showcasing packaging information within the Item Card component.</p>
        <img src="img/bs_1.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <p>In collaboration with internal team members, we conducted a review of the eight designs, discussing
          the likes and dislikes for each. Based on this feedback, I returned to Figma to integrate the most favorable
          aspects into an approach for displaying multiple packaging sizes sourced from multiple vendors.</p>
        <img src="img/bs_2.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <img src="img/bs_3.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <p>I engaged in multiple iterations of this process, continuously refining the design to strike a balance
          between intuitiveness, cleanliness and minimal disruption to the current implementation of the Item
          Card. Throughout these rounds, we carefully considered and incorporated feedback to ensure the final display
          of multiple packaging sizes from different vendors met our objectives. The staging UI, reflecting
          these changes, is presented below.</p>

        <h2>Redesigning Cart Builder</h2>
        <p>After designing a way for the user to create and manage a single item with multiple packaging sizes and
          vendors, the next step was to facilitate the seamless ordering of this item in different sizes from various
          vendors. To meet this requirement, my focus was on preserving the current UI as much as possible to minimize
          any disruption for the user. Utilizing Figma, I created a high fidelity mockup<span class="hide"> (Shown Below)</span> of proposed design enhancements.</p>
        <div class="hide"><iframe class="hide" style="border: 0;" width="800" height="450"
          src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2Fii4vCVpwgu2extqrcbatGm%2Fmulti vendor-Cart-Builder%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D1-4%26t%3D7BW932RYJ9CVZcie-1%26scaling%3Dscale-down-width%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26starting-point-node-id%3D1%253A1080%26mode%3Ddesign"
          allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
          <img src="img/bs_17.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image show">
        <p>Once the mockups were finalized, we arranged discussions with key users to gather their feedback on the
          designs. After a few minor iterations based on their input, I collaborated closely with an engineer
          to implement the required UI updates for accommodating multi vendor ordering. The staging UI, reflecting
          these changes, is presented below.</p>

        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Having enabled the creation and ordering of different purchasing options for the same item, our next step is
          to gather feedback using Maze and staging data. This feedback will be instrumental in iterating on the design
          prior to the official launch and identifying any critical bugs (P1) within the code. It's important to note
          that this implementation involves significant changes to the back end and existing data, necessitating a
          comprehensive release plan.</p>

          <p>Once these changes are pushed to production, we will need to ensure that the rest of the application,
          including inventory counting and reports, is modified to accommodate this new feature. This transition
          requires a thorough approach to ensure a seamless integration and minimize any disruptions to the existing
          functionality.</p>

          <p>Overall, this endeavor represents a significant change that requires meticulous planning, thorough testing and
          careful execution to ensure a smooth and successful adoption of the new capabilities and features within the
          application.</p>

        <p class="project-description">Improving the UX/UI behind the current invoice processing flow to enhance
          usage rates.</p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Users struggle to determine whether they should attach a returned process invoice to an existing order or
          create a new order. As a result, duplicate orders are frequently generated due to the uncertainty surrounding
          the items included in the returned processed invoice.</p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve the UX behind submitting processed invoices to attach to order records during submission process.
          </li>
          <li>Improve the UI behind attaching returned processed invoices to ask the right questions to prevent
            duplication.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Determining the User Flows</h2>
        <p>The initial phase of this project involved identifying and mapping out various user flows to guide the
          creation of mockups. Numerous decision points were identified, requiring careful consideration and inclusion
          in the process.</p>
        <img src="img/bs_8.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <img src="img/bs_9.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
        <h2>Redesigning the User Flow</h2>
        <p>After consideration for how users attach returned process invoices to order records today, taking in feedback
          from current users and the Customer Success team, I determined that the easiest solution would be to attach 
          invoices to order records upon upload.</p>
        <p>When users were recieving returned process invoices, they had no record of what was actually on the invoice
          besides the number of items, useless in most scenarios, and the vendor. I realized that when a user
          was uploading an invoice they had full context of what was on the invoice to reference for the order
          assignment.</p>
        <p>After presenting a solution for the uploading of the invoice, I determined that this flow would be useless 
          for returned invoices that users might get through a third party integration vs uploading it through our UI.
          Presenting the user with leading questions would indicate which action they should take whether to create new
          or attach to an order placed within app.</p>
        <p>Once the plan was established, I proceeded to use Figma for creating mockups illustrating the envisioned
          flow. To maintain consistency within the application, I aimed to reuse components whenever possible. After
          considering various options, I settled on a slide-in card design that would contain a questionnaire for the
          user.</p>
        <p>Through collaborative design iterations involving stakeholders, we arrived at a final set of mockups<span class="hide"> (Show Below)</span>. These
          mockups were then presented to users to seek their final approval.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Efficiently processing invoices and linking them to order records is crucial for our users' success. Our
          upcoming features will involve utilizing AI to identify received items on the invoice and compare them to the
          ordered items, enabling us to identify any missing items.</p>
        <p>We plan to integrate with accounting systems for restaurants and bars, allowing them to manage their financial 
          records with accurate, synced data. Ultimately, we intend to provide the capability to pay invoices directly 
          through our application.</p>
        <p>Throughout these future features, we will continuously iterate on the new user interface based on valuable
          feedback from users as they engage with this feature more and more.</p>
